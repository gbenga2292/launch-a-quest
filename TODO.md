# DCEL Asset Manager Refactoring Plan

## Priority Order (as requested)
1. âœ… Remove SQLite Backend Entirely
2. ðŸ”„ Code Refactoring (Break down large components)
3. ðŸ”„ Performance Optimizations (Pagination, lazy loading)
4. ðŸ”„ Implement Authentication System
5. ðŸ”„ Add Comprehensive Error Handling

## Step 1: Remove SQLite Backend Entirely âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Delete backend/ directory and all SQLite-related files
- [x] Remove backend scripts from package.json
- [x] Update docker/docker-compose files to remove backend service (no backend service found)
- [x] Clean up any references to local SQLite in frontend (removed better-sqlite3 dependency)
- [x] Update README and documentation

## Step 2: Code Refactoring
- [x] Fix type mismatch between useDashboardState hook and TabContent component (local types vs API types)
- [ ] Break down Index.tsx (600+ lines) into smaller components
- [ ] Separate business logic from UI components
- [ ] Create custom hooks for data operations
- [ ] Improve TypeScript types and interfaces
- [ ] Extract reusable components

## Step 3: Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement pagination for assets, waybills lists
- [ ] Add lazy loading for components
- [ ] Optimize Supabase queries with proper indexing
- [ ] Add caching strategies with React Query
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large lists

## Step 4: Implement Authentication System
- [ ] Set up Supabase Auth with email/password
- [ ] Create login/register pages with validation
- [ ] Add protected routes and role-based access
- [ ] Update AuthContext to use real Supabase auth
- [ ] Add user profile management

## Step 5: Add Comprehensive Error Handling
- [ ] Implement error boundaries for React components
- [ ] Add global error handling for API calls
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages and loading states
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed requests
- [ ] Network error handling and offline support

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify all CRUD operations work with Supabase
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical components
